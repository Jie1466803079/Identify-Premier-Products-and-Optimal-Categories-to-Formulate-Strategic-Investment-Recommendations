# Identify-Premier-Products-and-Optimal-Categories-to-Formulate-Strategic-Investment-Recommendations
**PROJECT INTRODUCTION**

This project serves to address NewChic.com's business objectives by extracting valuable insights from their e-commerce data within the women, men, house, and shoes categories. Through comprehensive data preprocessing and analysis, we have effectively tackled the core challenges facing NewChic. 

Employing advanced techniques, namely K-means and hierarchical clustering, we have successfully segmented the product landscape into meaningful clusters. This clustering approach not only enhances our understanding of NewChic's product offerings but also aids in identifying the top 10 products across the selected categories. 

Furthermore, our analysis has pinpointed the most promising category among women, men, house, and shoes, helping NewChic to strategically allocate resources and refine their marketing strategies.

To enrich the dataset, we enriched the product information by integrating the cluster outcomes, leading to improved product labelling. This refined dataset has enabled us to deploy robust classification algorithms, including K-nearest neighbours (KNN) and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), to perform accurate category predictions. 

The culmination of our analytical efforts has yielded actionable insights and recommendations, poised to empower NewChic in making informed business decisions. These insights not only provide a deeper understanding of customer preferences but also offer pragmatic suggestions to optimize revenue generation and operational efficiency.

In conclusion, this project holistically addresses NewChic's challenges, employs cutting-edge analytics to reveal crucial insights, and provides actionable recommendations, ensuring NewChic's continued growth and success in the dynamic e-commerce landscape.
